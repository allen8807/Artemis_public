I’m a journalism student. Uh, I wanted to ask you about the orchestra…\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nI’m sorry Eric, but the orchestra is only open to music majors.\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nReally? Well, see—\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nBut the policy’s changing next year. After that, if you’ve taken three music courses, you will be able to audition.\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nWell, uh, I have taken some music courses, and I do play the double bass, so maybe that’s something to think about. But actually, I was here about something else.\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nOh, sorry! It’s just I-I get that question all the time, so…\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nThat’s OK. Thing is, I work for Magna—the school paper—and I’m reporting on last week’s concert. Now, I went to it, and I really enjoyed it, but now I’m looking for some background knowledge.\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nWell, I can refer you to some of the students in the orchestra, if you’d like a young musician’s point of view…\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nUh, I-I guess that might be helpful… But um, I’m really looking for a little bit of scholarly perspective. Some history of the music that was performed that evening. Where it originated, how it’s developed over time…\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nWell, some of our musicians kind of specialize in Appalachian music; in fact, that’s part of the reason we performed it. So you really should talk to them, too. Um, OK, so we were playing Appalachian music… from communities in the Appalachian mountain regions of the United States.\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nAll right…\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nUh… do you really think you can keep this all in your head?\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nOh. Don’t worry. All I need are a few key facts. I’m sure I can keep them straight until I get back to my dorm.\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nSo. The music is generally based on folk ballads and instrumental dance tunes. Um, it started with Scottish and Irish immigrants who brought over their styles of music. It’s called Anglo-Celtic.\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nSo, people brought their musical traditions with them.\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nWell, this Anglo-Celtic music was considered an important link to the past for these people, which you can see in the way that Appalachian singers sing ballads; they have sort of a nasal quality to them, like in Celtic ballads. In their new land, some of the lyrics were updated, you know, to refer to the new locations, and the occupations that settlers had in America. But at the same time, lots of ballads were still about castles, and royalty… lords and ladies… stuff like that. Which is what they were about originally.\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nOK, and was that some sort of banjo I saw onstage during the performance?\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nYes, we’re lucky that one of our students, Stewart Telford, has a nineteenth-century banjo—a real antique. He’s able to play in most of the traditional styles. Did you know that banjos are of African American origin, and that settlers in Appalachia adopted banjos for their folk music? They became very common in traditional Appalachian music, along with guitars and violins, of course…. But if you want to learn about that banjo, talk to Stewart.\r\n\r\nMALE STUDENT\r\n\r\nThat’s great, Ms. Harper. Thanks a lot. Now, can you recommend any sources where I could look up more about this?\r\n\r\nFEMALE DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nSure, I have a great book. A student has it today, but you can borrow it tomorrow if you’d like.\r\n\r\n"
