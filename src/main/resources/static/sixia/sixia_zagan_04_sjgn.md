最近进行AI建模的过程中查阅神经学资料时思考的一个问题，因为最初是和外国朋友进行讨论的所以是用英文记下来的。  

When I check the research interests of neuroscientists, I noticed this:  
"We are using this task to study the neural basis of time perception. Unlike other perceptual modalities, there is no specific sensory organ for 'time'."  

At that moment, I don't have any detailed knowledge on neuroscience, but I asked myself the same question.  
I think we have a nature to feel the order of time, but how can we feel the length of it?  
My answer was:  

There may be something like "intrinsic speed" inside our brain and if we divide the information amount we feel by this "speed", we get the time we feel. And this speed is not always the same, it will change with our mood. (I notice that in some moods we feel that time is longer than usual.)  
Then I start to read something on neuroscience (I read Mark F. Bear's "Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain"), because I know that I will never be able to judge something until I really know it.  

 I notice a word "rhythm", and I think maybe this is just the "speed" I thought. But the book only talks about the rhythm when people sleep.  
When I'm building the model, time is actually the basic and only element for the relationship. Now it's just a small model and I can use the time of "experience" to synchronize every layer and sensor. But actually different sensor don't have the same sensible time quantum, and higher levels will not consider the detailed time information for its contents(which means that higher level will have more vague time/higher "speed"/bigger time of "cycle"). So different "rhythms" are needed for different sensors and layers.  

If this hypothesis is true:  
(1) Each organ should have its own rhythm.  
(2) When different organs are collaborating in one task, their rhythm will be synchronized.  
(3) Higher layers for analyses will have slower rhythm.  

很高兴这些假说在和一些神经学教授讨论时被证明符合神经学实验数据~
